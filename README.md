# Arty The Miner

Arty is a GitHub App (https://github.com/apps/artifactminer) that works together with a GitHub Workflow (https://github.com/jpratt-mru/starting-autograded-template/blob/master/.github/workflows/submit.yml) to provide a way for instructors to receive the result of a build that is kicked off when a student "submits" their repo via a manually-initiated even trigger.

_Translation: when a student is ready to submit their work, they go to the Actions tab in their repo, open up the Submit workflow, and select "Run workflow"_

I'm currently running this on a free-tier Heroku instance at https://arty-the-miner.herokuapp.com/

If you want to play around with this on a dev machine, you'll need to get the private cert for Arty from me, Jordan Pratt...and if you're not me, I won't likely be giving it to you. No offence. :)
